# Band Name Generator

A fun and simple Python script that generates a band name based on the user's inputs.

---

## How It Works

1. The script prompts the user to enter:
   - The name of the city they grew up in.
   - The name of a pet.
2. It combines these inputs to create a unique band name.

## Code Example

```python
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator.")
city = input("Which city did you grow up in?\n")
pet = input("What is the name of a pet?\n")
print("Your band name could be " + city + " " + pet)
