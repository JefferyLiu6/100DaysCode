# Pomodoro Timer

This project is a **Pomodoro Timer** built using Python and Tkinter. It helps users enhance productivity by following the Pomodoro techniqueâ€”working in focused intervals followed by short breaks.

## Features

- **Work/Break Intervals**:
  - Work session: 25 minutes (default, can be adjusted)
  - Short break: 5 minutes
  - Long break: 20 minutes (after 4 work sessions)
- **Countdown Timer**:
  - Displays the remaining time for work and break sessions.
- **Reset Feature**:
  - Allows users to restart the timer at any time.
- **Graphical UI**:
  - Uses a tomato-themed interface for a visually engaging experience.

### How It Works
1. Click **Start** to begin a Pomodoro session.
2. The timer will alternate between **work** and **break** intervals automatically.
3. Click **Reset** to restart the session.
